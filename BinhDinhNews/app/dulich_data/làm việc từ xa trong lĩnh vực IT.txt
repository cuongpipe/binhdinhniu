Working remotely in the IT field is a form of work where programmers or technology experts can do their work from anywhere via the internet, without having to go to the office. I envision this as a flexible environment where people communicate, manage projects and work in teams through online tools.

The advantages of working remotely are saving time, travel costs, time activities and easy balance between work and life. However, the disadvantages are being easily distracted, lacking direct interaction, difficult to build team spirit and sometimes feeling isolated.

Personally, I am willing to try working remotely after graduation if the job is suitable. I think this is a common trend in the IT industry, and I am practicing my online working skills, self-study, time management to effectively adapt to this form in the future.
